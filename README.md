## Introduction

This project, tentatively named 'Schadle', is a web-based application designed to facilitate scheduling and related tasks. It leverages a Python backend, likely built with FastAPI, to handle business logic and data processing, while the frontend is developed using standard web technologies: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements. The presence of `main_gemini.py` and `main_geminiy.py` suggests potential integration with or development related to Gemini models, possibly for advanced scheduling algorithms, natural language processing for task input, or intelligent automation features. The project also includes enhanced functionalities, indicated by files like `enhanced.bat`, `script_enhanced.js`, and `htaml_enhanced.html`, which might point to improved user experience, performance optimizations, or additional capabilities beyond a basic scheduling system.

## Features

- **Web-based Interface**: Provides an intuitive user interface for managing schedules and tasks.
- **Python Backend**: Utilizes FastAPI for robust and scalable backend operations.
- **Frontend Technologies**: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a dynamic and responsive user experience.
- **Enhanced Functionality**: Includes additional scripts and templates for improved features and performance.
- **Potential Gemini Integration**: Files like `main_gemini.py` suggest possible integration with Gemini models for advanced features such as intelligent scheduling or natural language processing.

## Installation

Instructions on how to install and set up the project.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the application, navigate to the root directory of the project and execute the main Python application. This project likely uses `uvicorn` to serve the FastAPI application.

```bash
uvicorn src.main:app --reload
```

Replace `src.main:app` with the correct module and application instance if `main.py` is not the primary entry point or if `main_gemini.py` or `main_geminiy.py` are intended to be run directly. After running the command, the application should be accessible in your web browser, typically at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

If there are specific functionalities tied to the `enhanced.bat` script, you can run it from the `scripts` directory:

```bash
cd scripts
enhanced.bat
```

For frontend development or if `htaml_enhanced.html` is meant to be opened directly, you can open it in your web browser.
